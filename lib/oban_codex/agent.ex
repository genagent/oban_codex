defmodule ObanCodex.Agent do
  @moduledoc """
  A facade over long-lived agent processes whose turns run as Oban jobs.

  > #### Experimental {: .warning}
  >
  > The agent layer is the stateful floor above the stateless `ObanCodex`
  > seam. It is opt-in (nothing runs unless `ObanCodex.Agent.Supervisor` is
  > in your tree) and experimental: the API may change between minor
  > releases while it carries this marker. See the
  > [Agent lifecycle](agent_lifecycle.html) guide.

  One agent is one `ObanCodex.Agent.Instance` (`:gen_statem`) registered
  under a caller-chosen id. A prompt does not block on Codex: it enqueues an
  `ObanCodex.Worker` job and the state machine parks in `:running` until the
  worker reports back through `job_finished/2`. All interaction goes through
  this module; nothing here messages a process that is not running.

      {:ok, _pid} = ObanCodex.Agent.start_agent("triage-7",
        args: ObanCodex.Args.defaults(model: "gpt-5"))

      :processing = ObanCodex.Agent.submit_prompt("triage-7", "triage the new issues")
      {:ok, :running} = ObanCodex.Agent.status("triage-7")

  Send a prompt to a running agent. Synchronous: replies `:processing` once the

  In `:running` and `:awaiting_permission` the call blocks (the machine
  postpones it) until the turn finishes / the gate clears; in
  `:waiting_for_user` the prompt is the answer to the pending question and
  resumes the Codex session.

  Options (shared with `cast_prompt/3`):

    * `:session` -- `:resume` (default) continues the agent's Codex session;
      `:fresh` starts a new one for this turn (the resume handle is cleared at
      delivery time, so it composes with queued prompts). Use `:fresh` to stop
      a long-lived agent's context from growing without bound.
    * `:origin` -- `:operator` (default) or `:tick`. A `:tick` prompt is a
      scheduled delivery: in `:waiting_for_user` it queues behind the pending
      question instead of being consumed as the answer.

  `submit_prompt/3` -- queued in `:running` / `:awaiting_permission`, the
  answer in `:waiting_for_user` -- except `:paused`, where the prompt is
  dropped (recorded as `{:dropped_prompt, text}`) since lockdown has no caller
  to refuse. Use this from callers that must not block on a busy agent (a
  LiveView event handler, a scheduler); use `submit_prompt/3` when you want
